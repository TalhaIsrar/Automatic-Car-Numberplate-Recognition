ABSTRACT: This report presents an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system utilizing YOLOv7 for license plate detection, DSP techniques for image preprocessing, and Easy OCR for character recognition. The system aims to enhance traffic management, law enforcement, and parking management through real-time and accurate recognition of number plates. Image preprocessing techniques, such as grayscale conversion, filtering, sharpening, and enhancing frequency changes, are applied to cropped license plate images. Easy OCR extracts characters, and the recognized text is plotted back onto the original image. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the system's effectiveness in various scenarios, contributing to enhanced public safety and operational efficiency in traffic management, law enforcement, and parking management.
